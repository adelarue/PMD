Prediction with Missing Data

This repository contains the code associated with the following research papers:

- D Bertsimas, A Delarue, J Pauphilet. Simple Imputation Rules for Prediction with Missing Data: Theoretical Guarantees vs. Empirical Performance. Forthcoming in _Transactions on Machine Learning Research_ (2024). [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03158)
- D Bertsimas, A Delarue, J Pauphilet. Adaptive Optimization for Prediction with Missing Data. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01543)

## How to read

The scripts used to generate plots and other empirical results in both papers are in the `engaging` folder. The `src` folder houses the actual implemented methods to pull/generate data as well as implement and evaluate prediction methodologies.
